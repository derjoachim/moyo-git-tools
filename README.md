==============
Moyo Web Architects currently works with shared git repositories, i.e. repositories that are shared amoung projects. To facilitate this workflow, a number of scripts has been written, some of which are currently being shared. These scripts have been released under the GPL3 license. A word of warning though: use these scripts at your own risk. If you bork your repo, that's on you.

Kind regards,
Joachim
